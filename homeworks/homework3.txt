Due the following class and we will talk the solution at the beginning of the following class.
Please ONLY submit it to black board. 

1. write a function to get the sum of 1 to n(inclusively) by using a list.

2. 1) create a list named a contains numbers: 10,9,8,... 1.
   2) print the first element of this list.
   3) print the first 3 elements of this list.
   4) print the last element of this list.
   5) get a reverse version of this list.
   6) what is the output of a new list c = a+a
   7) execute the follwing program to see what will happen:

while len(a)>0:
    this_element = a.pop()
    print('length of list a', len(a))
    print('a', a) 
    print('this_element', this_element)
