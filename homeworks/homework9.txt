Due the following class and we will talk the solution at the beginning of the following class.
Please ONLY submit it to black board. 
1. a = (1, )
 what is data type of a
2. a = (1, 2, 3, 4) + (3, )
is a hashable?
3. a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3]
is a hashable?
4. a = [[1, 2], [-10, 9], [0, 100], [1000, 0], [0, -1000]]
sort a by the absolute value of the second element.
5. Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

6. what is the time complexity of your solution for question 5.
