Due the following class and we will talk the solution at the beginning of the following class.
Please ONLY submit it to black board. 
1. Regarding dictionay, 
we have a following dict to record the test score of CSCI13200.

my_score_dict = {'jimmy':90, 'alex':89,'susan':90}
what will be the contents of 
list(my_score_dict.keys())
list(my_score_dict.values())
list(my_score_dict.items())
list(my_score_dict)

what will be the output of the following code
for key, value in my_score_dict.items():   
    print(k, v)

2. Dictionary again.

we have a list 
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 1, 5]
we have a defaultdict by using collections.
what will be the output of the following code

import collections
a_dict = collections.defaultdict(int)
for item in a:
    print(a_dict[item])
    a_dict[item] += 1
print(a_dict)


3. related to set
we have a list, run these code to see the outputs.
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 1, 5]
a_set = set(a)
print(type(a_set))
#what is the length of a
print(len(a))
#what is the lenght of a_set
print(len(a_set))


Question? how to find unique elements of list a by using set. (hint, set contains elements without repeating. you can convert a set into a list by using list(a_set))
