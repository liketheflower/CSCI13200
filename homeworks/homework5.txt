Due the following class and we will talk the solution at the beginning of the following class.
Please ONLY submit it to black board. 

1. Write a function to get the sum of 1 to n(inclusively). Using both bottom up and top down ways to explain your solution and write the code. (hint: You can initialize the s=[0]*(n+1). Then s[0]=0, s[1]=s[0]+1, s[2]=s[1]+2 ... s[n]=s[n-1]+n)

2(this one is optional). Write a function to caculate the factorial(n). Using both bottom up and top down ways to explain your solution and write the code. (hint: factorial(n) = 1*2*3*(n-1)*n = (1*2*3..*(n-1)) * n = factorial(n-1)*n )

3. given a list a
for all two consecutive elements: a[i], a[i+1], return the pair which has the maximum value of a[i]+a[i+1]. Return the indexes of these two items.

Example 1:
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
the maximum pair will be 3 and 4. So the maximum value will be 3+4
the indexes will be 2, 3.
Example 2:
a = [1, 20, -30, 4, 18, -19]
the maximum pair will be 4 and 18. So the maximum value will be 4+18
the indexes will be 3, 4.

4. The following list :
                   [[0, 0],[0, 1], [0, 2],
                    [1, 0],[1, 1], [1, 2]]
    can be easiler generated by using:
a=[[i,j] for i in range(2)
         for j in range(3)]
Try to run the following code to see what will happen.


a=[[i,j] for i in range(5)
         for j in range(10)]
b = sorted(a, reverse=True)
print(b)

5(optional). Try to create your own repo on github and save your codes there.
