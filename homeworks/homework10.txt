Due the following class and we will talk the solution at the beginning of the following class.
Please ONLY submit it to black board. 
1. What is the time complexity of binary search?
2. a = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
what is bisect.bisect(a, 7) 
what is bisect.bisect(a, 0) 
what is bisect.bisect(a, 6) 
3. What is the time complexity of bisect?
4. Please write a code by using both sequentical search and binary search to guess the price of a product.
The highest possible price is 10**9 and it is a sceret price, your program will not be given in advance.
